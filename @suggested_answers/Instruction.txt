Big-picture architecture
Clients
•	Passenger app – Expo React Native
o	Request ride, see driver on map, track status, history
•	Driver app – Expo React Native
o	Go online/offline, accept rides, share live location, see earnings
•	Admin dashboard – Web (React)
o	Your screenshots: stats, recent rides, driver management, services, etc.
Why web for admin?
Admins usually work on laptop/desktop. It’s much easier to make a dashboard with React for web, and your design already looks like a web app. Passenger & driver stay as mobile apps with Expo.
Backend
•	NodeJS (Express) REST API
o	Auth (Admin / Driver / Passenger)
o	CRUD for users, drivers, rides, pricing, etc.
o	Dashboard endpoints (totals, recent rides, etc.)
•	WebSocket layer (e.g. socket.io)
o	Realtime ride state (requested, assigned, in_progress, completed)
o	Realtime driver locations
o	Notify admin dashboard of active rides in real time
•	MySQL database
o	Persistent storage (users, rides, payments, etc.)
•	Ngrok
o	Exposes your local Node server to the internet so your phone (Expo app) and anyone else’s device can hit https://<random>.ngrok.io.
